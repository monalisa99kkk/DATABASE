                      ANSWER

1.SELECT* FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE SALARY = (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
 WHERE SALARY <(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY < (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES))); 

         --- 2ND WAY ---

SELECT* FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE SALARY = (SELECT DISTINCT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES 
ORDER BY SALARY DESC
LIMIT 2,1);


2.SELECT* FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE SALARY = (SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
 WHERE SALARY >(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY >(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES)))
LIMIT 1; 


      ---- 2ND WAY ----

SELECT* FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE SALARY = (SELECT DISTINCT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES 
ORDER BY SALARY ASC
LIMIT 2,1)
LIMIT 1;

3.SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE HIRE_DATE > (
    SELECT HIRE_DATE FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE FIRST_NAME = 'Steven'
    LIMIT 1
)
LIMIT 1;


4.WITH 3RDHIGHEST AS
               (SELECT DISTINCT SALARY AS SAL
                FROM EMPLOYEES 
                ORDER BY SALARY DESC
				LIMIT 2,1),
                
		3RD AS 
        (SELECT * FROM  EMPLOYEES,3RDHIGHEST
         WHERE EMPLOYEES.SALARY = 3RDHIGHEST.SAL)
  

SELECT * FROM 3RD;


-- 2ND WAY --

WITH MAX1 AS (
    SELECT MAX(SALARY) AS SAL FROM EMPLOYEES
),
MAX2 AS (
    SELECT MAX(SALARY) AS SAL FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE SALARY < (SELECT SAL FROM MAX1)
),
MAX3 AS (
    SELECT MAX(SALARY) AS SAL FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE SALARY < (SELECT SAL FROM MAX2)
)
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY = (SELECT SAL FROM MAX3);



4.part2

with min1 AS
            ( 
              SELECT MIN(SALARY) AS SAL1
              FROM EMPLOYEES
              ),
   MIN2 AS 
			  (
                SELECT MIN(SALARY ) AS  SAL2
                FROM EMPLOYEES
                WHERE SALARY >( SELECT SAL1
              FROM MIN1)),
MIN3 AS      
               (
                SELECT MIN(SALARY ) AS  SAL3
                FROM EMPLOYEES
                WHERE SALARY >( SELECT SAL2 FROM MIN2)
              )
                                
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY = (SELECT SAL3 FROM MIN3)
LIMIT 1;
